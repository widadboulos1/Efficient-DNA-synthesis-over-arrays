# Efficient-DNA-synthesis-over-arrays

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

In this project there are 6 files:
1) README file
2) requirements.txt: includes the python packages that need to be installed to run the code.
3) dssp.py: includes the DSSP algorithm with 2 strings as an example, when running this file, you'll get the DSSP algorithm on those 2 strings.
4) dssp_script.py: includes the DSSP algorithm which takes 2 strings as input from the user.
5) machine_order_dp.py: includes the DP algorith which decides the machine order with 4 strings as an example, when running this file, you'll get the DSSP algorithm on those 4 strings.
6) machine_order_dp_script.py: includes the DP algorith which decides the machine order which takes 4 strings as input from the user.


### Prerequisites

You need to run this instruction before running the codes:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
