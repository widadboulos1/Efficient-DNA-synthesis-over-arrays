# Efficient-DNA-synthesis-over-arrays

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

In this project there are 6 files:
1) README file
2) requirements.txt: includes the python packages that need to be installed to run the code.
3) dssp.py: includes the DSSP algorithm with 2 strings as an example, when running this file, you'll get the DSSP algorithm on those 2 strings.
4) dssp_script.py: includes the DSSP algorithm which takes 2 strings as input from the user.
5) machine_order_dp.py: includes the DP algorith which decides the machine order with 4 strings as an example, when running this file, you'll get the DSSP algorithm on those 4 strings.
6) machine_order_dp_script.py: includes the DP algorith which decides the machine order which takes 4 strings as input from the user.


### Prerequisites

You need to run this instruction before running the codes:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
